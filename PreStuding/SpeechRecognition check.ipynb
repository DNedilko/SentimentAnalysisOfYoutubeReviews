      "so I've been using the iPhone 14 Pro Max for over a month now and if you remember initially when I bought this phone I had a lot of concerns about getting the bigger pro Max model so for this video I want to talk about my month over month now I'm using a 14 Pro Max and how important are the new features like the new dynamic Ireland and the Always on display and is this camera system really that big of an upgrade and also stay tuned and make sure you watch every part of this video because I bought an extra iPhone 14 Pro that I want to give away to one of the people watching this video we could probably you now I have more rolls later in the video but the easiest way to enter us to just leave a comment down below and tell me what you want and iPhone 14 Pro and I like the hashtag Greg's gadgets give away just to make it easier but before you do all that you might have noticed that when you purchased your iPhone 14 Pro there was something missing yes Apple phones no longer come with a charging brick included and why you could go buy some cheap single port charger let me show you a better alternative this is your Green's new 141 charging break yes you didn't hear me this charging right here has 141 Max capacity and if you're wondering how they fit all that what agent to this relatively medium-sized power well it's because of ugreen gan technology and while some Power bricks just give you one poor connection you greens 140 watt charger give you access to to high speed USB c charging ports and 1 USB a port for maximum compatibility is 140 watt charger even features the new cutting-edge PD 3.1 protocol to charge your products even faster charge a full-size 16-inch MacBook Pro 256 percent capacity in just 30 camera system with smart HDR like with the sample photos I took the HR just looks really unnatural to me but those are just two small cases out of a bunch of photos that I took where I wasn't necessarily pleased with the results but for the most part I am pleased with most of the pictures that does 14 Pro Max Camera system takes what's really quite the camera system to me as you can utilise the full 48 megapixel sensor if you choose to toggle apples pro setting and it's one of the reasons why I love this camera so much because when you do toggle that you get a picture with much more detail when you drop in and it gives you much more flexibility for blowing up these pictures if you want to print them out there's also some negatives with this feature and the first will be that it drastically slows down the camera when using 48 megapixel sensor and it does take a few seconds to press the shutter again and take another picture compared to the regular mode because they are rough photos meaning at a really make them shine you're going to want to edit them and a photo editing app so I think most normal users watching this video who don't edit photos you probably don't need to use the 48 megapixel raw sensor like it's probably not a feature that you're going to appreciate but for me or for people who do editor photos this increased flexibility is another tool in the tool bell when it comes to deciding how you want to take photos and it makes this camera system for me much more versatile now apple also utilises this bigger 48 megapixel sensor to introduce a new 2x camera mode where basically digitally crops into the sensor to zoom but still give you a full 12 megapixel photo at twice focal length this is one of my new favourite features on the iPhone 14 plus camera system because honestly I will always default using the main camera system not the wide angle lens or the zoom lens because the main camera usually looks so much better especially in Lower light situations and because of this I can still get a zoom in on a subject and get very similar quality to the main One X camera by using this to explore because it's using the main camera sensor other cameras are still there the ultra wide is the best option if you need to capture every subject in the frame and can possibly back up anymore and it's still has that useful macro mode where you can get really close up two subjects and take a close-up photo with lots of detail camera is there to providing just a bit more zoom for far away subjects most of the time I don't want to use it because it results in a poor quality photos and the new 2x camera and I think of Apple wants to keep a third zoom lens on here they should increase the magnification to at least a580 doesn't have too much is here as it is very baffling but I guess apples just waiting for another iPhone year to update that plants at least I hope so perhaps one of my favourite camera upgrades actually has nothing to do with this rear camera system it's on the front facing camera which Apple has updated to now include autofocus and gave it just a better or sensor the results from this are just crazy going like the front facing camera is probably better than older rear camera systems that the iPhone used to have and honestly it's not the pictures I like the most famous upgrade it's the video party that you get out of the front facing camera really shines to me like the best way that I can describe the benefits of this upgrades for the front facing camera is before I would just know how inferior the front facing camera was compared to the rear camera so if I wanted to like record like a selfie video I just rotate the camera so that the rear camera was like this right so I can do this and I take a video but then I can see myself which is kind of annoying when you're trying to blame yourself in a video well now I don't feel the need to do that anymore I'm going to take a selfie selfie video I just use the front camera because the quality is that good using that match compared to the rear camera video All Around is just really great looking only 13 pro cinematic mode is also great now I can do 24 frames per second at 4 k and I can look really convincing sometimes I create a nice or official blur reaction is just fun for outdoor use provided you haven't lied to demonstrate the capabilities of the 14 pros use Canesten actually shot an entire video on it when using the iPhone 14 plus which you can find right here address and personal things that I purposely stayed for the end of the video and Factor and my life so when I first bought this phone I was really worried about the size and weight and yeah this is the biggest and heaviest phone that Apple has ever sold and you can definitely feel that and while I was really worried about using such a big phone after being on the 12 Mini and then the 13 pro I have to say that the experience hasn't been terrible like the most annoying thing with this size and weight I just putting in my pocket like it feels like a break in my pocket sticks out of my pocket and I don't like that but it is an acceptable trade-off for me not necessarily for the bigger display I wouldn't I don't really care about that too much but for battery life one thing I want it with this phone when buying it was better battery life because I was worried if I use this as a tool for my channel to record more videos with which I have pretty much done in almost every year since I purchased this phone what I wanted to make sure that on heavy days of usage I could use this phone all day with no problem I actually did do just that it got stress test Day in the Life video I took this phone and used it to shoot video and photos all day and yeah the phone battery can still drain if you use it intensively normal days the phone has been making it through the entire day of normal using it with around 30% battery life remaining before I go to bed I feel like it's about 20% better in battery life than my order iPhone 13 pro and I'm happy to have the extra battery life on my 14 Pro Max because of how much I have been using this as a video camera my normal days I have been very happy with the battery life so far again I've been using this phone for over a month now there is not a time in a typical day of usage or this phone did that lasts me through the entire day of the question do I regret getting the iPhone 14 Pro Max so do I recommend it to the first part of it I don't regret quote from the biggest size I'm actually happy to carry around the bigger phone for the increase battery life and I'm glad that I have increased battery capacity over my iPhone 13 pro compared to just how much whatever using this camera I think you've heard enough about my use of it and my praises and listen I do recommend the iPhone 14 Pro if you're getting a new iPhone this year listen I think the right choice is the logo with the iPhone 14 Pro or the 14 Pro Max the upgrades to these models over the regular 14 and the 14 + are worth the extra $200 and as for an upgrade thankfully modern iPhones last for a while so if you own an iPhone I'm 13 or 13 pro and you don't need any of these new features just stick with that for another year if you're 12 is still doing fine stick with that don't feel the need to rush out and just buy this phone just because it's new I feel like that time of upgrading iPhone every year it's been 1/4 now but listen not everyone's on an iPhone 13 and iPhone 12 and iPhone 11 if you're on older iPhone there has been so many upgrades added between all these phones from the last 3-years that are packed into this new iPhone 14 Pro compared to older phone that is a really going to add up and I think those owners are really going to appreciate everything the iPhone 14 Pro has to offer this is a really great phone I know I myself have been really enjoying this phone I think it's probably one of the bigger iPhone upgrades actually to come out of the last few years because of this new dynamic Ireland and this new always on display and of course that you camera system so I actually don't like people expecting this to be small update I feel like it is kind of a bigger update than most people expecting I think this is probably the biggest change to the we've had since the iPhone 10 so yes I do recommend buying either an iPhone 14 Pro or this big iPhone 14 Pro Max Ernst the

make sure you check out the link in the description to get 25% off your own ugreen charger and thank you your green not only for keeping my text charged before also sponsoring this video is very similar to the iPhone 13 pro Max in a lot of ways it's just a bigger iPhone 13 pro Max with a bigger camera bump and the removal of the notch in exchange for this new pill shaped cut-out or as apple refers to it the dynamic dynamic Ireland is really cool first of all I love all the slick and playful animations that Apple has incorporated into this design every time that I swipe up and see the music player going to the dynamic Ireland or use Face ID or getting over like the airpod battery is running low or there's like a phone call it is such a visual delight that still makes me smile every time I see all these little animations that have occurred in here all around it's just a better and more consistent system for displaying those status alerts but the dynamic Ireland is more than just showing alerts it also acts as a new multitasking interface don't not in the traditional sense so if an app takes advantage of the dynamic Ireland they can show information on that top section like for musical podcast you can see a small preview of the album artwork and then a visualise or if you set a timer on actually see the timer coming down right from the dynamic Ireland and you can log press onto these two to review more information at a glance kind of like a small separate multitasking window always present at the top of your iPhone and it also works as a quick way to switch between apps think of it as a more active dark that two apps can take advantage of a quick tap on the app in the dynamic Ireland takes you directly to the app is a quick and easy way to manage those active apps and switch between them now there's been a lot of questions about the usefulness of the dynamic Ireland and so far I have found that the dynamic Ireland has been useful and I really use it a lot for things like music controls timers and 4 map directions however even after 1-month it's clear that this is just the start of a new way to interact with their iPhones user interface however it is far from being a necessity just yet because so many of the apps that I use on a daily basis has still not been able to be updated to take advantage of this new interactive interface but long-term I can already see the usefulness of this feature when every app takes advantage of it and when you can expect those apps to be up there in the dynamic Ireland when all these apps are taking advantage as they get updated this is going to be a lot more useful and I have the same praise and criticism for another new iPhone interaction the new always on display this is a nother radical shift in the relationship we have with the iPhone especially with the way that Apple chose to implement it's always on display compared to attend a car parts would usually displays a dark background with minimal information on the lock screen that sell apples always on display takes a more liberal approach the always on display looks exactly like you have your lock screen set even shows you your wallpaper Justin well just anymore them stay but even then the always on display can be in direct sunlight by then you'll see the time day and lock screen widgets as well as if you have any new notifications for this new always on display too quick for me but once I did I felt like I was another stroke of genius for another part of apples new user interface live activities for example take a look at this music activity on my lock screen not only can I see what song is playing but I can also see the full layout of controls player and I can quickly grab my phone tap and start using those interface controls now imagine another live activity app again we can use the example or let's go for something different like your Starbucks order or maybe even a baseball game on TV and it quickly becomes apparent why apples always on display is so much more useful and so much more well-thought-out because it doesn't require you to keep unlocking your phone to see these really important information or status updates these live activities will always be on your phone and once you get used to it it kind of reduces that anxiety of leaving your phone on the table picking up and constantly checking it like I have found that now and I can just leave it always on display with the expectation of those light activities I can kind of feel that habit going away kind of like how when I get my Apple watch isn't necessarily always have to check my phone for notifications I feel like that's going to be a very similar experience unfortunately I've only had one are really even updated so this is still something where it's an open question on just how useful will these features be 6 months down the road I hear down the road or even as we get into future phones like the iPhone 15 now there's a lot of other small improvements to the iPhone 14 Pro display now gets really bright at like 2008 Mac screen brightness to listen to All I display gets really bright and it still looks really really good that there's also a new a 16 chip and benchmarks fast I mean it's performance is faster than even apples and one chip and its closely approaching like Max scores in multi-core performance but that doesn't like it's always great to get more performance and yes technically the phone should age better as It Gets after updates but at least in my use it hasn't made my phone fuel noticeably faster now there's also other new features that aren't out yet I mean if you heard that before so the news headline collectively feature which can give you emergency satellite access when you're not near a cellular tower but it's not out yet with you and hopefully never had to review it because that should only be used in emergencies but there's a coffee to admit that there are a few new features here beside you always on display in the dynamic Ireland like most recent iPhone years the story with the 14 Pro is mostly centred around the improvements to the camera system and there's a lot to love you and maybe something that kind of confusing about what I will say is that the iPhone 14 Pro has my favourite camera system in my life forever surprise the newest iPhone has the latest camera technology but it is not a perfect Emma either so let's start off with the new 48 megapixel sensor is a big jump up in the megapixel count for Apple which has been shipping 12 megapixel sensors on its phones since the iPhone 6s and still does on the regular iPhone 14 now in regular use apple ulises 40 megapixel sensor and use a process called pixel Binning which basically means the camera sensor captures the day of a 48 megapixel photo and emergencies pictures together basically to condense that down and bring it back down to a 12 megapixel resolution so it doesn't take up space on your phone and I might experience is usually results in photos with more detail than the iPhone that just have you 12 megapixel sensor overall photos look crisp have a bit more punch in the colours to them and I can't really take some stunning photos without loss in speed when pressing the camera shutter I will say one critical part I have with the camera system is some of the weirdest illusions that makes now to me with this example I would say that I prefer the choices the iPhone 14 camera made the regular iPhone 14 compared to the iPhone 14 Pro I like the iPhone 14 photo better and I've also found some other weirdness with the 14 Pro\n",
